# Market Competitiveness Assessment of Different Search Engines - Google and Baidu as Examples

1 - Introduction  
Google, a.k.a. Google LLC, is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. It was founded in September 1998 by Stanford Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin; it is now, two decades later, considered one of the Big Five technology companies in the US. Over the years, Google has extended its reach so much that it is now the biggest search engine in the world, with its website, www.google.com, being the most visited website worldwide. With unique offerings at an international level, Google has become dominant in the global internet search arena, strong anywhere in the world—with the exception of in China.  

Indeed, in China, the online search market is dominated by another company, named Baidu. Deemed Google’s Chinese counterpart, it is a Chinese multinational technology company based in Beijing’s Haidian District. Like Google, Baidu too specializes in Internet-related services and products in addition to its search engine, which is ranked 2nd in the world—second only to Google (as of 2020). By concentrating only on China’s online search market, Baidu has amassed knowledge and experience on the local Chinese language and culture, enabling it to optimize its search engine and algorithms to the needs of local users.   

At present, both Google and Baidu are trying their hands on grasping each other’s markets. Google, albeit limited in its operations in China, first launched Google China in 2000, and after retracting its services due to a few rough patches with the Chinese government, reattempted its reach in the Chinese online search market in 2016. Meanwhile, in its endeavour to compete globally, Baidu has launched its Global Business Unit (GBU), a unit responsible for Baidu’s international products and services for markets outside of China.   

In this project, we would like to compare the two technological giants through various aspects. If Google was the Chinese multinational technology company operating in China, would it succeed the way Baidu has, and vice versa?  

2 - Motivation  
We chose this topic because we are very curious about what would happen if Google and Baidu compete on a level playing field in China and if Baidu decides to invest more resources in competing with other search engines outside of China. We know that since Google withdrew from the Chinese market in 2010 due to content censorship issues, Baidu now has the highest market share in China, but obviously, outside of China, Google has the highest market share, so if the Chinese government lifts restrictions on Google and allows Google to return to the Chinese market, will Baidu still be able to take the lead? Likewise, what adjustments can Baidu make today to be more competitive and capture its users' needs when facing the world? Because at present, although Baidu can be accessed worldwide, he only has a Chinese version, obviously his focus is on the Chinese market. On the other hand, the search engine business is only a division of Google, but for Baidu, the search engine business is almost a whole company, if Google really returns to the Chinese market today and succeeds in getting back its market share, it would really be a devastating blow to Baidu, what kind of measures Baidu might take to recover?  

3 - Research ideas  
Task 1: Study the differences between the global market where Google is located and the Chinese market where Baidu is located.  
Due to different markets, there may be huge differences because of factors such as culture, politics, habits, etc. In order to develop smoothly in the local market, companies usually adopt local practices in accordance with the characteristics of the market. Compared with other markets, the Chinese market is a relatively closed market. Since most companies are market-oriented, we believe that different markets will result in different business models, even if they provide the same service.  
Task2: Differences in business models  
As mentioned above, the different cultures and policies of each market cause different business models between companies of the same type. Our team want to study the differences between business models caused by different markets, because we think that differences in business models will result in different measures adopted by the terminal that ultimately provides services.  
Task3: the similarities and differences of terminal services  
The business model resulting from the adoption of different policies may have different characteristics in the part of the terminal application service provision. For example: the difference of search algorithm, the difference between additional application services like Google Drive, Baidu skydrive disk and additional restrictions, the purpose of the collected data and so on.   

4 – Results  
What would happen if Google and Baidu compete on a level playing field in China and if Baidu decides to invest more resources in competing with other search engines outside of China? We know that since Google withdrew from the Chinese market in 2010 due to content censorship issues, Baidu now has the highest market share in China, but obviously, outside of China, Google has the highest market share, so if the Chinese government lifts restrictions on Google and allows Google to return to the Chinese market, will Baidu still be able to take the lead?

We thought to figure out the problem above the market share of browser is one of most significant things.  

The size of Internet users reached 940 million, and the proportion of Internet users using cell phones reached 99.2%.  

Accroding to the market share of mobile device’s browse in the china, It's seems the market share of browser positively correleated with the brand of the mobile device.  

Here are the baidu search algorithms, 超鏈算法, 綠籮算法, 石榴算法, Until 2013, the above algorithm is baidu's main search engine algorithm, it is not difficult to see that there has been a prototype. The following will be in the introduction of baidu in recent years the use of algorithms. Like 白楊算法, 天網算法, 閃電算法, 驚雷算法, 極光算法etc.  We can see that in addition to the basic search algorithm, baidu's algorithm is adjusted by content quality, user experience, and user safety.  

Based on the above information, we think that although google search engine has the highest market share in the world, but if it returns to China, it can't win over Baidu, one is that Chinese Internet users are currently using cell phones to access the Internet, the default search engine of Chinese brand cell phone browser will not be google, even if google returns to China, most of the grassroots people do not need to Even if google returns to China, most of the grassroots people do not need to use google, because baidu can originally meet their needs. However, for highly educated people, as well as business people, senior management, etc., once google returns to China, the chance of them switching to google is very large, after all, baidu can not well meet their needs, so we think that when google returns to China, in the short term they will be 50-50, but with the continuous progress of China, the number of high-end population growth, google's market share will slowly increase. Google's market share will slowly increase and then surpass Baidu.  

Google has mainly three search algorithm,  
Google Panda:  
The main purpose is to punish low-quality and content-poor websites, so as to provide users with the most relevant and original search results. In short, the web page does not provide enough useful information for readers, excessively piling up keywords, trying to improve page ranking by improving the relevance of the web page to user queries, and websites that lack original content as the following three points will be punished by Google :  
a.Thin Content: The webpage does not provide enough useful information for readers.  
b.Keyword Stuffing:The page is over-stacked with keywords, trying to improve the page ranking by improving the relevance of the page to user queries.  
c.Duplicate Content: The web content lacks originality, mostly copied from other websites.  

Google Penguin:  
In the early days, when people discovered that backlinks are related to page ranking, they tried to establish a large number of unnatural backlinks, which are artificial, fake or tampered links pointing to their own web pages to improve rankings. In view of this, Google has published the Penguin algorithm to monitor the reverse link behavior of each website. All actions that use unnatural reverse links to manipulate page rankings may be punished.  

Rank Brain:  
To put it simply, Google’s search results are no longer based solely on the matching of web keywords and user query terms, but provide the most appropriate online information based on the user’s search intent. RankBrain has introduced an artificial intelligence system to more accurately determine the user's search intent, analyze the quality of the website's content, and optimize search results.  

About browsers, Microsoft's Edge uses the same engine as Google, based on Chromium, and consumes less memory capacity compared to chrome. It has already squeezed Firefox into second place. Firefox is the default browser of the Linux system. What is more special is that the current market share of Apple computers can be roughly estimated from the market share of the browser on the PC side.  

On the mobile side, Android may have two default browsers: Samsung’s Samsung Internet and Chrome. Samsung Internet was originally a web browser pre-installed on Galaxy phones and tablets. Later, Samsung opened it to all Android devices.  

Samsung Internet is also based on Chrome, but has a fully customized interface, which is more in line with Samsung's user interface. Compared with Chrome, the advantages are tracking protection, and button layout that is easier to use on smart mobile phones.  

Baidu browser, currently only the mobile version is still being updated, and the PC terminal has stopped updating. Baidu Browser integrates many of Baidu's own application services, and is also trying to build its own user ecology.  
For Apple phones, all third-party browsers need to use the Safari rendering engine, and Google allows any web browser engine to be sent to Play for installation on Android phones.  
 
Baidu and Google are also different in click ads. Baidu has Baidu Promotion and Google has Google Ads. The charging rules of the two are similar. Both are based on the bid and the quality of the advertisement to determine the click charge. However, compared to Baidu, Google pays more attention to the quality of advertising, while Baidu pays more attention to bidding.  
Google: Having a higher ad quality score can lower the price of ad clicks and save costs for enterprises. In addition, high-quality advertising will also win more potential customers for the company.  
Baidu: it is more inclined to bid, Baidu's automatic bidding system is more inclined to bid higher ads to get higher rankings.  

Other Baidu Plus Points:  
In 2016, the Chinese government identified artificial intelligence (AI) as one of the key priority areas and began the implementation of a new government strategy. Many consider Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, which are the bases of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent respectively, to be among the leaning AI-development hubs in the world. China is developing such significant research and technological capabilities in AI in an effort to overtake the Western, and perhaps the most powerful indicator for their increasing capability is Google's decision to re-open its Chinese research operation with a focus on AI.  

In the last five years in particular, Baidu, along with Alibaba and Tencent, have made enormous technological advancements in data collection, aggregation, interpretation, and in algorithm development. With the former points, a strategy called the Platform Business Group, or PBG, has allowed them to generate massive volumes of data, as well as provide new data-based AI innovations to an enormous market that in size nearly rivals that of their US counterparts. Additionally, because of the enormous amount of data they have accumulated, they are now also aggressively trying to exploit all sorts of AI. On top of all that, they are also getting more and more funds, since venture capital investments in AI technology have also grown rapidly even as the Chinese platform leaders have accelerated investment in AI--according to CB insights, AI startups have raised over $10 billion in aggregate equity funding globally.  

Baidu, specifically, began investing in AI in 2013 when it established the Institute of Deep Learning, shortened IDL, followed by investments in four other internal AI labs. The Baidu Cloud and the Baidu Brain are both products of these laboratories, with the former now providing an infrastructure to produce, analyze, and tag data, and the latter an algorithm platform open to complementary parties. Baidu has also been apply its newly-developed AI technologies in new fields by creating two more platforms, which are the self-driving platform Apollo and the customized AI operation system DuerOS. Baidu also invests in other companies in the fields of self-driving mobility and speech interaction. Baidu is strong in the self-driving--having done 1971 miles of vehicle testing in California in 2017--and also interactive AI, while still experimenting in the fields of finance and retail. In addition, Baidu search is also becoming more versatile with the integration of speech and image recognition.  

BAT may be able to expand beyond China into other countries, particularly in South, Southeast and Central Asia. While it is difficult to definitively assess 
the technological capabilities of the Chinese firms, there is anecdotal evidence that the Baidu self-driving platform, Alibaba’s cloud computing services, and Tencent’s perception and cognition technologies, at least, rival their US West Coast counterparts. Moreover, it might still be possible for BAT to expand globally by leveraging AI to strengthen their existing advantages, especially their world leading payment services. So, all in all, the Chinese platform giants--and that includes Baidu--have access to enormous data sets that rival those of their US counterparts, and that may potentially act as an equalizer.   

5 – Conclusion  
Baidu's investment in China's AI field is the earliest and has a comprehensive planning. The results cover multiple levels of software, hardware and algorithms. It has some similarities with Google and is a typical platform-based AI company.  
At the AI application level, Baidu leveraged the general trend of China's intelligent industrialization to apply AI in finance, customer service, urban, medical, autonomous driving and other fields through cloud computing.  
Since the real Chinese market share is based in rural areas, second-tier cities, and third-tier cities, these areas basically use Chinese mobile phone brands to access the Internet, and most of them are bound to Huawei or QQ browsers, and they tend to use baidu for Internet Search. These people are accustomed to using Baidu, not so easy to change their habits, so we believe that after Google returns to the Chinese market, the competitiveness of Baidu should be the same.
